export const helpText = `Hi, I'm the Slack Archivist.

I can send useful conversation threads to the Zeebe forum, to capture valuable information. 

When you see a thread worth capturing, tag me with @archivist in a reply to the conversation, and I'll send the thread to the forum, and keep watching it for updates. 
  
If there are no replies (you want to archive a single post) then reply to the OP (your reply creates a thread) and tag me in that reply.

When you tag me, put the text you want as the post title. For example:

@archivist How do I find out what the latest version of X is?

I don't respond to DMs, but you can chat to me in #archivist.
