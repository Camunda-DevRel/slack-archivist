# Todo

* What to do about duplicate posts?
    - Check the thread for the archivist output on a previous post.
    - If it exists, then check Discourse to see if the post still exists.
    - If it doesn't, create a new one.
    - If it does, report this to the user.

* Incremental update
    - Watch archived conversations, and incrementally update them.
