# Slack Archivist

Your friendly Slack-to-Discourse archivist.

This is a Slack bot that can ship threads off to a Discourse instance as forum posts on request.

It was inspired by Dgraph's [Wisemonk](https://github.com/dgraph-io/wisemonk), and built for the [Zeebe.io](https://zeebe.io) community Slack.

One of the issues with hosting a community on Slack is the loss of history. Valuable discussions and answers to questions quickly scroll over the 10,000 message horizon. A number of technical communities have moved to Discord to deal with this.

We looked at doing that, but then saw an opportunity to build a searchable knowledge base on our [forum](https://forum.zeebe.io) by sending valuable threads there as posts. There they can be curated by editors, indexed by Google, and discovered by other members of our community searching for answers.

Dgraph had a similar idea a few years ago, and built Wisemonk in Go. It hasn't been updated for a few years, and I couldn't get it to work - so I coded this up in TypeScript, using Slack's Web API and Events API.

## Using in Slack

In a thread (this is important - your conversations need to be threaded), @ the bot with what you want as the title. The bot will then roll up the thread and turn it into a forum post.

Example:

Here is [the post](https://forum.zeebe.io/t/zeebe-failover/980) generated from this thread.

## Prerequisites

Obviously you will need a Slack where you can add bot users, and a Discourse instance where you can get an API key. You will also need to run the bot with a resolvable DNS address, or at least an external IP, as it needs to listen to Push notifications from Slack's Event API.

Here are the [instructions about creating a bot user on Slack](https://api.slack.com/bot-users). You only need to do steps 1 - 3.

The bot will need the following scopes in its OAuth settings:

* app_mentions:read
* channels:history
* channels:join
* channels:read
* chat:write
* im:history
* im:read
* im:write
* incoming-webhook
* links:read
* links:write
* reactions:write
* users.profile:read
* users:read
* users:write

## Running from Docker

Read the `docker-compose.yml` file and set up either the environment variables or a `config.json`. Then run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Installation from source

To install, clone the repository, then run: 

```
npm i
```

## Configuration

Rename `config.json-example` to `config.json`, and fill in your Slack bot and Discord details. The promoMessage is optional. If present, it will be added to forum posts.

```
{
    slack: {
        "token": "",
        "signingSecret": "",
        "promoMessage": "This post was generated by [Slack Archivist](https://github.com/jwulf/slack-archivist) from a conversation in the Zeebe Slack, a source of valuable discussions on Zeebe ([get an invite](https://zeebe-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)). Someone in the Slack thought this was worth sharing!"
    },
    "discourse": {
        "token": "",
        "user": "",
        "url": "with a trailing slash",
        "category": 1
    }
}
```

You can also configure Slack Archivist via environment variables:

```
# Required
DISCOURSE_TOKEN
DISCOURSE_USER
DISCOURSE_CATEGORY
DISCOURSE_URL
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET

# Optional:
SLACK_PROMO_MESSAGE
```

## Running

You can run the bot using `ts-node`: 

```
npm i -g ts-node
ts-node src/main.ts
```

Or by transpiling to JS:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Bot Behaviour

The bot behaviour is described in the [Behaviour.bpmn](Behaviour.bpmn) file.
